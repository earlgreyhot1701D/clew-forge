# Clew Forge

**Where your reasoning threads become real artifacts.**

Turn structured thinking into shipped projects. Clew Forge is a project framework for builders who want to move fast without losing clarity‚Äîperfect for hackathons, indie sprints, and teams shipping real things.

---

## Why Clew Forge?

### The Problem
You have an idea. You know what to build. But then you hit the fog: *What should I document? How do I keep my thinking straight? Where do I track decisions? How do I explain this to my team (or judges)?*

Most frameworks make you choose: Ship fast or stay organized. Clew Forge says: **Why not both?**

### The Solution
Clew Forge gives you a structured path from idea ‚Üí shipped product. It's opinionated enough to guide you, flexible enough to adapt. And it's built for the way real builders actually work.

**Three simple files to start:**
1. `REQUIREMENTS.md` - What are you building?
2. `tasks/todo.md` - What are the steps?
3. `docs/activity.md` - What did you do today?

That's enough structure to ship something real.

---

## What You Get

### üßµ Clear Thinking
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Define your problem, users, and success criteria
- **PRD.md** - Product roadmap (optional, but helps)
- **MVP_SCOPE.md** - First version boundaries
- Activity logs that show your thinking process

### üèóÔ∏è Organized Building
- Tasks organized by phase
- Decisions tracked and documented
- Architecture decisions recorded
- Code quality checks built-in

### üöÄ Ready to Ship
- LLM integration (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Vertex)
- Activity logs judges and investors love
- Pre-commit hooks catch problems early
- GitHub Actions validate everything

### ü§ù Community Ready
- Contributing guidelines included
- Code of conduct established
- Open to contributions (easy, medium, hard paths)
- Future roadmap shared transparently

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone Clew Forge
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clew-forge my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Read GETTING_STARTED.md
```bash
cat GETTING_STARTED.md
```

### 3. Fill Out Three Files
```bash
# Define what you're building
vim docs/00_BOOTSTRAP/REQUIREMENTS.md

# List your tasks
vim tasks/todo.md

# Start logging progress
vim docs/02_EXECUTION/activity.md
```

### 4. Start Building
```bash
# Connect your LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, etc)
cat LLM_INTEGRATION.md

# Use your LLM for the heavy lifting
# Update your activity log as you go
./scripts/log.sh "Feature X completed"

# Push when ready
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: X"
git push
```

**That's it.** You're now shipping with structure. üöÄ

---

## ü§ñ Pro Tip: Use Your LLM to Trim the Fat

**Here's the secret:** Upload the entire Clew Forge repo + your project idea to Claude, ChatGPT, or your LLM of choice, and ask it to recommend which docs you actually need.

```
"I'm building [your idea] in [timeframe].
I have this framework with 20+ docs.
Which ones should I use? Which can I skip?
Here's the full repo: [paste or upload]"
```

Your LLM will:
- ‚úÖ Analyze your situation (solo vs team, timeframe, complexity)
- ‚úÖ Recommend Quick/Standard/Full mode
- ‚úÖ Tell you which docs are essential
- ‚úÖ Guide you through execution
- ‚úÖ Adapt as you build

**This is the whole point of Clew Forge.** It's not just a framework‚Äîit's a framework designed to work with AI. Your LLM becomes your co-pilot, helping you stay organized while moving fast.

---

## üéØ Quick Mode: Start with These 3 Files

All you need for a 48-hour hackathon or weekend project:

### 1. Define It
**`docs/00_BOOTSTRAP/REQUIREMENTS.md`**
- What problem are you solving?
- Who uses this?
- How do you know it works?
- **Time:** 5 minutes to fill out

### 2. Plan It
**`tasks/todo.md`**
- Features you're building
- In priority order
- **Time:** 5 minutes to list

### 3. Track It
**`docs/02_EXECUTION/activity.md`**
- What you built each hour
- Why you built it that way
- What's next
- **Time:** 30 seconds per entry (ongoing)

**Put your code at the root level. That's it. You're shipping.**

---

**Everything else in Clew Forge is optional.** Add them only if you need more structure:
- `PRD.md`, `MVP_SCOPE.md` ‚Üí Add if you have a co-builder
- `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` ‚Üí Add if your system is complex
- `DECISIONS_LOG.md` ‚Üí Add if you're making important choices
- Deployment guides ‚Üí Add before shipping to production

---

**You have 48 hours. Clew Forge was built for exactly this.**

### Why Use Clew Forge in a Hackathon?

1. **Structure removes decisions** - You know what to do next (no blank page)
2. **Activity log is your competitive advantage** - Judges see your thinking, not just code
3. **Quick Mode is made for speed** - 3 files, not 30 docs
4. **LLM integration makes you faster** - Your co-pilot handles boring parts
5. **You look professional** - Documentation, deployment, intentionality

### The 48-Hour Timeline

**Friday Evening (7pm - 9pm):** Setup
- Clone Clew Forge
- Read GETTING_STARTED.md (15 min)
- Fill REQUIREMENTS.md (15 min)
- Write todo.md (15 min)
- Set up your LLM (15 min)

**Saturday (9am - 9pm):** Build
- 6 hours: Core features
- 1 hour: Lunch
- 6 hours: More features + first deploy
- Update activity log as you go

**Sunday (10am - 5pm):** Polish & Ship
- 3 hours: Polish + mobile responsive
- 1 hour: Lunch
- 2 hours: QA + final deploy
- 1 hour: Practice your pitch

### Why Judges Love Clew Forge Projects

Traditional hackathon project: Commits without clear narrative
Clew Forge project: Clear structure + activity log showing your thinking

Judges see:
- ‚úÖ You know how to organize work
- ‚úÖ You made intentional decisions
- ‚úÖ You shipped something real
- ‚úÖ You understand product thinking

**That's a 2x better impression than just code.**

### Real Example

Team X built a [project name] in 36 hours using Clew Forge:
- **Friday evening:** Setup + requirements (they knew exactly what to build)
- **Saturday:** Built core + deployed (activity log showed progress)
- **Sunday:** Polished + presented (judges saw the whole journey)
- **Result:** [outcome]

**üëâ [Read the full hackathon guide ‚Üí](./HACKATHON_GUIDE.md)**

## How It Works

### Three Levels of Structure

**Quick Mode** (48 hours or less)
```
docs/
  ‚îú‚îÄ REQUIREMENTS.md (what you're building)
tasks/
  ‚îî‚îÄ todo.md (what you're doing)
docs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ activity.md (what you did)
+ Your code
```
That's enough. Ship it.

**Standard Mode** (1-2 week project)
```
docs/00_BOOTSTRAP/
  ‚îú‚îÄ REQUIREMENTS.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ PRD.md
  ‚îî‚îÄ MVP_SCOPE.md
docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/
  ‚îî‚îÄ [your design]
tasks/
  ‚îî‚îÄ todo.md
docs/activity.md
+ Your code
```
Clear organization. Still fast.

**Full Mode** (serious project)
```
Everything above, plus:
- docs/02_EXECUTION/ (decisions, QA, logs)
- docs/03_DEPLOYMENT/ (security, scaling, integration)
- docs/04_REFERENCE/ (changelog, roadmap, philosophy)
- docs/05_TOOLING/ (automation, guides)
- scripts/ (automation suite)
- All the good stuff
```
Professional, scalable, ship with confidence.

### The Philosophy

Clew Forge is built on one idea: **Your reasoning should be as clear as your code.**

Too many projects have great code but no record of *why* decisions were made. Clew Forge fixes that by making documentation natural, not a burden.

## The Philosophy Behind Clew Forge

### On Naming
**Clew** comes from Greek mythology: Ariadne gave Theseus a thread (clew) to navigate the Minotaur's labyrinth. Your project reasoning is your thread through complexity.

**Forge** is where reasoning becomes real. Where ideas become artifacts. Where thinking becomes shipping.

Together: **Where your reasoning threads become real artifacts.**

### On Structure
Structure isn't about bureaucracy. It's about clarity. Clew Forge is opinionated about *what you think about* (requirements, decisions, progress) but flexible about *how you think* (your tools, your pace, your style).

### On Shipping
Shipping is where ideas matter. Documentation without shipping is academic. Code without documentation is chaos. Clew Forge bridges both: structured thinking that enables shipping, shipping that validates thinking.

**A:** No! Hackathons are where it shines, but it works for any project: startup MVPs, indie projects, client work, team projects. Use Quick Mode for speed, Standard Mode for balance, Full Mode for complexity.

### Q: Do I have to use all the documentation?
**A:** No. Start with Quick Mode (3 files). Add more as you need it. It's your project.

### Q: Can I use Clew Forge with my existing project?
**A:** Yes! Copy the templates you like. Ignore the rest. It's designed to be modular.

### Q: What if I don't have an LLM?
