# Project Philosophy
- Clarity over cleverness
- Small files, single responsibility
- Write the *why*, not the *what*
- Prototype in public when possible
- Accessibility is a feature
- Respect constraints: time, budget, attention
- Scale responsibly: design for horizontal growth, backpressure, and graceful degradation.
