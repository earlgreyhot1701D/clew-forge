# Hackathons & Indie Sprints: The Clew Forge Advantage

**You have 48 hours. Let's ship something real.**

Clew Forge is built for exactly this: structured execution under time pressure. No bureaucracy. No overthinking. Just building.

---

## Why Clew Forge Wins in Time-Constrained Projects

### The Problem You Face
- **Decision fatigue** - What do I build first?
- **Scope creep** - Added features mid-project
- **Lost context** - Forgot why we chose X over Y
- **No narrative** - Can't explain your thinking to judges

### How Clew Forge Solves It
- **Structure removes decisions** - Follow the framework
- **Activity log is your proof** - Judges see your thinking
- **Quick Mode is fast** - Get to coding in 5 minutes
- **LLM integration speeds building** - AI handles boring parts

---

## The 48-Hour Hackathon Plan

### Friday Evening - 7pm to 9pm (2 hours)

**Goal:** Setup complete, ready to code Saturday morning

**Step 1: Clone and Setup (15 min)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clew-forge my-hackathon-project
cd my-hackathon-project
```

**Step 2: Read GETTING_STARTED.md (15 min)**
- Understand Quick Mode vs Full Mode
- Spoiler: You're using Quick Mode

**Step 3: Quick Mode Setup (20 min)**

Fill out **one file**: `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
```markdown
# Requirements

## Problem
What are we solving? (1-2 sentences)
Example: "Teams waste time finding good dev tools. We're building a search engine for tools."

## Users
Who uses this?
Example: "Solo developers, startup founders, engineering managers"

## Success
How do we know it works? (What metric matters?)
Example: "Users find 3+ tools in under 2 minutes"
```

Fill out **second file**: `tasks/todo.md`
```markdown
# Project Todo

## Core Features (Saturday)
- [ ] Basic search UI
- [ ] Connect to [data source]
- [ ] Display results
- [ ] Test with 5 searches

## Polish (Sunday morning)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] One hour of styling

## Launch (Sunday afternoon)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Railway/Fly
- [ ] Make it public
- [ ] Tell 3 people about it
```

**Step 4: Set Up Your LLM (15 min)**

Copy `LLM_INTEGRATION.md` content into your LLM of choice (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Copilot)

Add your project context:
```
I'm building [your project name] in a hackathon.

Problem: [from REQUIREMENTS.md]
Users: [from REQUIREMENTS.md]
Success metric: [from REQUIREMENTS.md]

Tech stack: [JavaScript / Python / etc]
Deployment target: [Vercel / Railway / etc]

Here's my todo list:
[Paste from tasks/todo.md]

Let's ship something great in 48 hours.
```

**Step 5: First Commit (5 min)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Init: Hackathon project setup - [your project name]"
git push
```

**You're done.** It's 9:15pm. Go to sleep. You're ready.

## Why Judges Love Clew Forge Projects

### What They See

**Traditional Hackathon Project:**
```
GitHub: Few commits, unclear narrative
Judges: "Did they plan this? How did they build it?"
```

**Clew Forge Project:**
```
GitHub: Clear structure, organized commits
activity.md: Timestamp log showing thinking
Judges: "They were intentional. They shipped something real. They documented their process."
```

### What Judges Actually Say

"I see exactly what they built, when they built it, and why. This is professional."

"The activity log shows they made thoughtful decisions, not just hacked something."

"This structure shows they know how to ship products, not just code."

### Judge Feedback
"Great project. But what impressed us was your activity log. Shows you know how to build, not just code."

---

## The Secret Sauce: Activity Log

Your `docs/activity.md` is your competitive advantage.

It shows:
- **Intention**: You didn't just guess
- **Progress**: Clear phase completion
- **Thinking**: Why you made choices
- **Execution**: How you shipped under pressure

**Each entry:**
```
## 2025-10-19 - 2:30pm

**Completed:** Built search UI with filtering
**Why:** Needed MVP first, polish later
**Next:** Connect to API tomorrow
**Time spent:** 2 hours
```

Judges see: Professional execution. Thoughtful decisions. Real shipping.

---

## Quick Mode is Your Weapon

**Full Mode (for real projects):**
- REQUIREMENTS.md ‚Üê Done
- PRD.md ‚Üê Skip, you know what you're building
- MVP_SCOPE.md ‚Üê Skip, you don't have scope creep
- ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md ‚Üê Skip, it'll emerge
- 30+ docs ‚Üê Skip them all

**Quick Mode (for hackathons):**
- REQUIREMENTS.md ‚úÖ (just this)
- tasks/todo.md ‚úÖ (and this)
- docs/activity.md ‚úÖ (update as you go)
- Your code ‚úÖ (ship it)

**That's it.** Three files + your execution.

---

## LLM Integration: Your Co-Pilot

**What to Tell Your LLM:**

```
I'm in a hackathon. 48 hours. Let's build fast.

Here's what we're building: [project]
Here's the current todo: [paste from todo.md]
Here's what we've done so far: [paste recent activity.md entries]

Next up: [specific feature]
Should take: ~2 hours
Then we move to the next item.

Let's ship.
```

**Your LLM will:**
- Suggest the fastest approach
- Write clean code quickly
- Help with decisions
- Keep pace with you

**You maintain:**
- Final say on all code
- Design direction
- Architecture choices
- Quality standards

---

## Deployment: Options for 48 Hours

### Fastest (Recommended)
- **Vercel** (Next.js, frontend)
- **Railway** (Backend + database)
- **Fly.io** (Full stack)

Deploy in < 15 minutes. Seriously.

### During Hackathon
- Deploy Saturday 3pm (test)
- Deploy Sunday 4pm (final)
- Both take < 5 minutes

You're not deploying for scale. You're deploying for judges to see your project live.

---

## The Judging Advantage

### What Judges Actually Evaluate

1. **Does it work?** (Yes/No)
2. **Is it well-executed?** (Code quality, design)
3. **Did they think?** (Intentionality, decisions)
4. **Can they ship?** (Deployment, completion)
5. **Can they communicate?** (Demo, explanation)

### How Clew Forge Helps You Win #3

Traditional approach:
- Judges: "Why did you choose that tech?"
- You: "Uh... seemed good?"

Clew Forge approach:
- Judges: "Why did you choose that tech?"
- You: "It's in DECISIONS_LOG.md. Here's the reasoning we documented Saturday morning."
- Judges: üëÄ (impressed)

## Starter Commands for Your Hackathon

### Saturday Morning: First Build
```bash
# Tell your LLM this
"Let's build the first todo item. Here's what we need:
[from tasks/todo.md]
[from REQUIREMENTS.md]"

# When done
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: [what you built]"
./scripts/log.sh "Built [feature] - reasoning here"
git push
```

### Throughout Day: Update Progress
```bash
# Every time you ship something
./scripts/log.sh "Feature X complete - learned Y, next is Z"
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: X"
git push
```

### Before Submission: Final Check
```bash
# Run QA
./scripts/qa-check.sh

# If it passes, you're ready
git add .
git commit -m "Final: Hackathon project ready for demo"
git push
```

---

## After Hackathon: What You Have

**If you don't win:**
- You shipped something real
- You have a portfolio project
- You learned something
- You have all the code, organized

**If you do win:**
- You have a production-ready codebase
- You can continue building
- You have investor-ready documentation
- You know how to ship fast

**Either way:**
- You have `docs/activity.md` showing your thinking
- You have a portfolio piece
- You have proof you can execute

## Pro Tips for Hackathon Success

**Tip 1: Don't Skip Setup**
- Friday evening: Do all the setup
- Saturday morning: Ready to code
- Not Saturday morning: Starting setup
- Big difference

**Tip 2: Use Quick Mode**
- Forget Full Mode for 48 hours
- 3 files + code
- That's enough structure
- That's plenty

**Tip 3: Commit Often**
- Every 30-60 minutes
- Small commits
- Clear messages
- Judges see intentional building

**Tip 4: Update Activity Log Daily**
- 2 minutes per day
- Shows judges your thinking
- Differentiator from other projects
- Makes demo rehearsal easier

**Tip 5: Deploy Early**
- Saturday 3pm: First deploy
- Gives you time to fix
- Sunday morning: Still have time
- Sunday evening: You know it works

**Tip 6: One Feature Complete is Better Than Three Half-Done**
- Ship one complete feature
- Polish it
- Works > Perfect unfinished

**Why use Clew Forge for your next hackathon?**

1. **Structure removes distractions** - You focus on building
2. **Activity log is your differentiator** - Judges see your thinking
3. **Quick Mode is literally made for 48 hours** - 3 files, not 30
4. **LLM integration makes you faster** - Your co-pilot does boring parts
