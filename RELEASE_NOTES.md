# Clew Forge v1.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## What's New in v1.2

This release fixes 4 critical issues that were breaking the core value proposition: **clarity**.

### 🔴 Critical Fixes (Breaking Issues Resolved)

#### 1. ✅ Fixed Inconsistent File Paths
**The Problem:** Users were getting contradictory instructions
- README said: `vim docs/activity.md`
- GETTING_STARTED said: `docs/02_EXECUTION/activity.md`
- Scripts expected: `docs/02_EXECUTION/activity.md`

**User Experience:** "I followed the README, but GETTING_STARTED says it's somewhere else. Is this broken?"

**Resolution:** All paths now consistently use `docs/02_EXECUTION/activity.md`
- Moved file to logical location (execution phase)
- Updated README.md with correct path
- Updated GETTING_STARTED.md with correct path
- Verified scripts use correct path

**Impact:** 🟢 Users can now follow instructions without confusion

---

#### 2. ✅ Completed Architecture Documentation
**The Problem:** ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md was a 1.5-line stub
```
# Architecture Overview

Components, data flow, external services, trust boundaries.
```

**User Experience:** Downloads framework → opens ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md → sees placeholder → "This is incomplete"

**Resolution:** Replaced with 600+ line comprehensive documentation including:
- Three-layer philosophy explained
- Complete directory structure with legend
- Data flow diagrams
- Decision points for mode selection
- Scaling examples
- When to use each folder
- Philosophy behind structure

**Impact:** 🟢 Users now understand the entire system architecture

---

#### 3. ✅ Fixed Broken Cross-References
**The Problem:** Documentation links pointed to non-existent files
- README linked to: `./docs/01_ARCHITECTURE/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` (wrong path)
- GETTING_STARTED referenced:
  - `docs/TEMPLATE.md` (doesn't exist)
  - `docs/MODES.md` (doesn't exist)
  - `examples/weather-dashboard/` (doesn't exist)

**User Experience:** Clicked link → 404 or file not found

**Resolution:**
- Fixed README link to correct path: `./docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
- Removed references to non-existent files from GETTING_STARTED
- Verified all remaining links are valid

**Impact:** 🟢 All documentation is internally consistent

---

#### 4. ✅ Made Quick Mode Visually Distinct
**The Problem:** Users saw 20+ files and didn't know which were essential
- README said: "Ship in 48 hours with just 3 files"
- But project folder showed 20+ markdown files
- Users got overwhelmed and unsure what to do

**User Experience:** "Am I supposed to fill out all 20 files? This doesn't look like '3 files'"

**Resolution:** Added clear "Quick Mode: Start with These 3 Files" section to README
- Explicitly shows 3 essential files
- Explains that everything else is optional
- Shows when to add additional files
- Clear hierarchy: Quick → Standard → Full

**Impact:** 🟢 New users immediately understand what's required vs optional
